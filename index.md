# Daily ETF Movers Watch - 2025-12-29

## Top 5 ETF Gainers
### 1. JDST
- **Price:** $2.63
- **Change:** +12.39%
- **Analysis:** The ETF JDST tracks *junior gold mining companies* with a *3x inverse leverage*.

Its rise is likely driven by a significant decline in gold prices, spurred by a hawkish shift in monetary policy expectations or a strengthening U.S. dollar, which reduces gold's appeal as a safe haven and inflation hedge.

### 2. DUST
- **Price:** $7.46
- **Change:** +12.01%
- **Analysis:** DUST tracks the inverse, leveraged performance of gold mining companies.

The likely reason for this move is a decrease in gold prices, driven by strengthening bond yields and a robust dollar, which makes non-yielding gold less attractive.

### 3. LABD
- **Price:** $20.34
- **Change:** +3.99%
- **Analysis:** The ETF LABD (Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3X Shares) **tracks the inverse (3x leveraged) performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index.**

This move likely reflects a sell-off in the speculative biotechnology sector, possibly driven by renewed concerns about higher interest rates impacting growth stocks or a broader shift to risk-off sentiment.

### 4. YANG
- **Price:** $24.75
- **Change:** +3.47%
- **Analysis:** The ETF YANG tracks the **triple-leveraged inverse performance of a basket of major Chinese companies**, effectively betting against Chinese equities.

The likely reason for this move is continued investor concern over China's economic slowdown and a lack of effective stimulus measures, leading to a decline in Chinese equity markets.

### 5. EWY
- **Price:** $98.72
- **Change:** +3.01%
- **Analysis:** EWY tracks the performance of the **South Korean equity market**.

This move is likely driven by improving global economic sentiment, especially for the technology and semiconductor sectors which are heavily represented in the South Korean market.
